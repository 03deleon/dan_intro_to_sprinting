# intro_to_sprinting
The point of this project is to make eager beginners successful contributing to
sprints as quickly as possible.

The problem has been that beginners need to learn much before they can
contribute and they are limited by the sprint leader's availability to help
them learn. The sprint leader becomes the bottleneck. The beginners don't learn
enough quickly enough to contribute, so little is accomplished and everyone is
frustrated.

This project aims to fix that by having the materials and instructions for the
beginners to teach themselves the bare minimum to become productive, and to
have a little sample project for them to practice sprinting on. When they
complete that, they are ready to contribute to the real project of interest.

This represents a high-level overview of the steps, tools and tradecraft needed
to introduce beginners to open source sprints.

This overview will walk attendees through the following open source skills in
both a discussion format **and** a hands-on format.

* Understanding, creating, and using virtual environments
* Using version control tools such as git and github
* Hands-on: Creating additions and changes to an open source project
* Getting those changes incorporated into an open source project

In addition, the overview will include numerous resources for self-study.

This project is based on anaconda, git, and github for Python sprints.
This project can be modified for the needs of other sprints.
