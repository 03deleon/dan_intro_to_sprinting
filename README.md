# intro_to_sprinting
The point of this project is to help beginners be successful contributing to
sprints.

The problem has been that beginners need to learn much before they can
contribute and they are limited by the sprint leader's availability to help
them learn. The sprint leader becomes a bottleneck. The beginners don't learn
enough quickly enough to contribute, so little is accomplished and everyone is
frustrated.

This project aims to fix that by having the materials and instructions for the
beginners to teach themselves the bare minimum to become productive, and to
have a little sample project for them to practice sprinting on. They can still
get help from the sprint leader, but since most of their learning is on their
own, the sprint leader is not a bottleneck and will be more likely to be
available when needed. When they complete that, they are ready to contribute to
the real project of interest.

# continued
This represents a high-level overview of the steps, tools and tradecraft needed
to introduce beginners to open source sprints.

This overview will walk attendees through the following open source skills in
both a discussion format **and** a hands-on format.

* Understanding, creating, and using virtual environments
* Using version control tools such as git and github
* Hands-on: Creating additions and changes to an open source project
* Getting those changes incorporated into an open source project

In addition, the overview will include numerous resources for self-study.

This project is based on anaconda, git, and github for Python sprints.
This project can be modified for the needs of other sprints.

# Prerequisites

Beginners will need to already know the following.

1. How to edit plain text files on their computer.
2. (add other things here)

# questions

- Who is the audience of this file? the beginners? the sprint leader? both?
  - Should it be directed towards the beginner even if sprint leaders would
    read it also?
- What can we learn from others? from Habit For Humanity?
