# Setting up Git

## Time-box

<XX> Minutes


## Overview

When you contribute to a project, you'll want your name associated with your contributions. Git will automatically attach your name and email address to every commit you make if you tell it how.


## What to do

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "<Your Name here>"
$ git config --global user.email "<your_email@domainname.com>"
```

**Note:** You'll only need to do this once on your computer.


## The big picture

## Deep dive

### Introduce yourself to the command line

`git` is a command-line tool, and as such you will be doing a lot of typing when you work with it.  

If you need a primer for the command line, check out the [free course on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). If you just need a quick reference, check out the [Linux commands cheat sheet on It's Foss](https://itsfoss.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheets/).
