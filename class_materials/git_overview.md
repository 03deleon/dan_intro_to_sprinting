# Using Git

## Time-box

<XX> Minutes


## Overview

Git is a version control system - it enables you to control the various versions of projects, such as open source projects.

Version control systems, along with managing changes to projects, help ensure every contributor is working on the same codebase.

Git is a tool that makes it easy to contribute to projects that other people are
working on. The project code lives in a central **remote repository**, traditionally called
`origin`. Programmers copy the project into their own **local repository**,
where they can work on adding features and squashing bugs. When finished, they
push the code back into `origin`, for other contributers to see and pull from.

### Command-line interface

We will be using `git` from the command line in this course. There are a lot of commands, and they can be kind of confusing. That's OK... it will start to make sense once you do it a few times. And that's why you're here!

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based git tools

There are Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools available as well, but they are beyond the scope of this workshop.

... and there are many others.
