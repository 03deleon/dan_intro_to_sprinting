## Overview

When you start working with live projects, there are additional things you will need to configure besides `git`, including:

* editors
* build tooling
* test tooling

These tools are going to be different for every project, but generally follow some common standards depending on the language the project is written in.

Talking about the nuances of any project is definitely beyond the scope of this workshop, but the following lessons will help get you started in a few kinds of cases that the authors have worked with in the past.

## Call for Contributions

If you would like to contribute general setup guidelines for a language you use, we encourage you to do so. We definitely see the need for:

* JavaScript/Node
* C/C++
* Java
* R
