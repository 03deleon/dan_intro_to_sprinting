# Student Preparation


## Time-box

N/A: this should be completed prior to the start of the course.


## Overview

This section is intended for the workshop student. It outlines what students should do to get the most out of the workshop.

Not all contributors to open source projects are programmers, so this workshop makes no presumption that participants know how to program. Contributions to open source projects include documentation, design, graphics, user experience, etc. This workshop will enable programmers and non-programmers alike to contribute. 

Having said that, the following will help with successfully completing this workshop:

* a desire to learn and experiment
* a basic understanding of the operation of a computer
* a basic understanding of command-line tools 


## What to do

### Learning methods

The workshop is about four hours and covers a lot of material. Anything you can do to optimize your learning experience will be beneficial. Below are just some suggestions:

* Ask questions. Lots of questions. Take advantage of the fact that you are in a room with mentors to get your questions answered. 
* Participate
* Take notes


### Using the command line

In the hands-on practice session, you will be using command-line tools to contribute to a practice project, namely a calculator. If you don't feel comfortable with the command-line yet, these cheatsheets have a number of the most common commands:

* [Windows command-line](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2017/1102-spring/Command%20Prompt%20Cheatsheet.pdf)
* [Linux/Mac command-line](https://files.fosswire.com/2007/08/fwunixref.pdf)
