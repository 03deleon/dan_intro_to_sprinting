This intro has several key sections. The beginning is a general intro. The next section is intended for instructors to enable them to prep for the workshop. The last section is intended for students to help them prep for the workshop.

# What to expect

This workshop covers...

* [Lesson 02](./lesson_02_tool_installation.md): installing a basic set of tools often used in open source development
* [Lesson 03](./lesson_03_venv_overview.md): An overview of virtual environments, a tool to keep the code from one project separate from other projects
* [Lesson 04](./lesson_04_github_overview.md): An overview of github, a version control repository
* [Lesson 05](./lesson_05_git_overview.md): An overview of git, a form of version control software
* [Lesson 06](./lesson_06_intro_to_the_project.md): An introduction to the sample project
* [Lesson 07](./lesson_07_project_hands_on.md): The sample project: a way cool calculator -  a hands-on project so the students can practice, repeatedly, all of the skills from A to Z of contributing to a project.

# What not to expect
This workshop does not cover...

* How to program
* Programming in Python

This is not a programming workshop, nor is it a Python workshop. It is intended to prep students to contribute to open source projects, it is not intended to teach students how to program.

The example code in this version of the workshop is written in Python, but this project can be run using an example project in another programming language. 

# Learning objectives

Participants should expect to achieve the following learning objectives upon completing this workshop:

* Be able to install the following software
* Be able to create a virtual environment
* Be able to use git and github to create a copy of an open source project on their own computer
* Upon editing OR adding content to the project
  * incorporate others changes to the project into their own local copy
  * correct any conflicts between their changes and other's changes
  * successfully issue a request for their contribution to be added to the open source project

# Prerequisites

Not all contributors to open source projects are programmers, so this workshop makes no presumption that participants know how to program. Contributions to open source projects include documentation, design, graphics, user experience, etc. This workshop will enable programmers and non-programmers to contribute. 

Having said that, the following will help with successfully completing this workshop:

* a desire to learn and experiment
* a basic understanding of the operation of a computer
* a basic understanding of command-line tools 

In the hands-on practice session, you will be using command-line tools to contribute to a practice project, namely a calculator. 

# For the Instructor

*  This section is intended for the workshop instructor
*  It outlines what the instructor should do to successfully execute this workshop

# Teaching methods

This workshop is intended to be as 'hands-on' as possible. While some lecture and demonstration is necessary, the focus is on having participants spend the majority of their time working on using the skills demonstrated. As such, the workshop focuses on the following

* Short sections of lecture to elaborate on the what and the why
* Short demos to show participants what to expect
* Hands-on practice labs 
* Side-saddle mentoring and question answering
* Pair programming to enable participants to help each other
* Hands-on project classwork to enable participants to practice all the skills in a supportive environment.

# Learning objectives

# Prep

* create a copy of the basic course material on github so that students can manipulate the calculator code freely, without cluttering up the master copy
* walk the students through each session

# For the Student

* This section is intended for the workshop student
* It outlines what the student should do to get the most out of the workshop
