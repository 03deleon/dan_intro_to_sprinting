# Using GitHub Part Deux: Just Deux It

Now that you've seen how to make changes 

## Submit a Pull Request

**NOTE**: the following steps are to be used **AFTER** you have made changes to the project and are ready to share those changes with the original project author. 

**NOTE**: We are presuming that your changes have **already** been pushed to your OWN Github repo (instructions on how to do this are covered in the next lesson: [Git Overview](./lesson_05_git_overview.md). 

Once your changes have been pushed to your own Github repo, you will need to submit a Pull Request.
 
1. Above the file list on the left hand side, click on "New Pull Request:"<br>
![New Pull Request Button](images/new-pull-request-icon.png)
2. Github will allow you to confirm which changes in your repo you want to share with the original author, as shown in the following image. **NOTE**: Github transfers you to the repo of the original author, so you will no longer be on your Github account page. 
3. Before proceeding, you should check for the following items.
  * Confirm that the **base fork** is your fork
  * Confirm that the **head fork** is the original author's fork
  * Confirm that Github says: **Able to merge** (IF there are conflicts, refer to the [Git Overview](./lesson_05_git_overview.md) for instructions on how to fix this problem.<br>

4. Click on "**Create pull request**"
5. Follow these steps to prep the Pull Request for creation:
    * Write a Summary Title describing your changes
    * Write a brief Description of what you're changing in this pull request
    * Click on "**Create pull request**"<br>

* **REMINDER**:  This leaves you in the original author's repo (Chalmer Lowe in this case) and not your own!

# Hands-on

Once you have made changes to your local code:
        
1. Push those changes back up to your github account (Details on how to do this will be covered in the next lesson: [Git Overview](./lesson_05_git_overview.md))
2. Return to your github account and issue a pull request, as described in the instructions above.
