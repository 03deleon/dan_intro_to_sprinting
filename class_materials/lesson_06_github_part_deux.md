# Using GitHub Part Deux: Just Deux It

Now that you've seen how to make changes 

## Pull Requests

**NOTE**: the following steps are to be used **AFTER** you have made changes to the project and are ready to share those changes with the original project author. 

**NOTE**: We are presuming that your changes have **already** been pushed to your OWN Github repo (instructions on how to do this were covered in the previous lesson: [Git Overview](./lesson_05_git_overview.md).

Once your changes have been pushed to your own Github repo, you will need to submit a Pull Request.

## Submit a Pull Request
 
1. Above the file list on the left hand side, click on "New Pull Request:"<br>
![New Pull Request Button](images/new-pull-request-icon.png)
2. Github will allow you to confirm which changes in your repo you want to share with the original author, as shown in the following image. **NOTE**: Github transfers you to the repo of the original author, so you will **no longer** be on your Github account page. 
3. Before proceeding, you should check for the following items.
  * Confirm that the **base fork** is your fork
  * Confirm that the **head fork** is the original author's fork
  * Confirm that Github says: **Able to merge** (IF there are conflicts, refer to the [Git Overview](./lesson_05_git_overview.md) for instructions on how to fix this problem.<br>

4. Click on "**Create pull request**"
5. Follow these steps to prep the Pull Request for creation:
    * Write a Summary Title describing your changes
    * Write a brief Description of what you're changing in this pull request
    * Click on "**Create pull request**"<br>

* **REMINDER**:  This leaves you in the original author's repo (Chalmer Lowe in this case) and not your own!

# What happens next...

If the author of the original project agrees with and approves your **suggested changes** they will merge the changes to their project.

Success!

Now, go do it again!
